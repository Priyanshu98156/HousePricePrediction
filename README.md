<h2>📜 Model Training</h2>

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling).

Model training using Random Forest and XGBoost.

Model evaluation using R² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE).

<h2>📊 Results</h2>

Random Forest:

MSE: 0.2487

R² Score: 0.8175

XGBoost:

MSE: 0.2197

R² Score: 0.8388

The XGBoost model outperformed Random Forest, achieving a lower MSE and a higher R² score, indicating better predictive accuracy.
